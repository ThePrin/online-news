            <p> The 2008 year group of University of Ghana Tescon executives, headed by Kwaku Ohene Djan (Osonoba) is set to embark on a nationwide tour of Tescon-NPP branches across the country. The purpose of this gesture it is believed, is to galvanise the Tescons- which are the intellectual wheels of the New Patriotic Party towards a robust 2024 Election campaign. This undertaking, would be in colloboration with the National Youth Wing and the National Tescon Cordinator. Speaking to The Principal, George Pese Danquah the 2008 Organizer opined that the time has come for all to come onboard to help the NPP break the 8-year jinx of political party succession in Ghana. 
                The former Vice President Kwaku Gyasi, who is in charge of securing resources for this operation also expressed concern about the NDC alternative the country faces if the NPP is unable to break this cycle. The team paid a courtesy call on Mrs. Harriet Kyerematen who is former Women Organizer of the 2008 group. She expressed her appreciation to the team for their visit and promised to contribute to the operation, describing it as 'essential'. The first stop is expected to be UG-Tescon, Legon. There, the team is expected to make cash donations,T-shirts and Laptops to the branch. The team is planning a visit to Kumasi, where they would meet Akwasi Owusu-a former Dept Press Secretary. He is also expected to make personal donations to the operation. The team also includes Alhaji Faisal(1st Vice President), Dr. Mark(General Secretary), Stephen Amaning(Treasurer), Nana Adjoa(Dep Women Organizer), Israel(Press Secretary) and Nana Amoako(Dep Treasurer).
