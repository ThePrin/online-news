                Oldham Unity has scheduled its Annual General Meeting(AGM) for the 23rd of Marh. This date was affirmed during their Commitee meeting held on Thursday 26th of January, 2023 at the Oldham Baptist Church.
             
                 
                 <br>
                 At the meeting various strategies were discussed to enhance the operations of the group in line with the exergencies of the moment; including the war in Ukraine and increased post-covid demands. 
                 <br>
                 Until the interruption of covid, Oldham Unity provided a choice of food to the value of about £10 to asylum seekers who are not entitled to government support. Since it reopened after covid, small amounts of cash in place of food have been provided to those asylum seekers who are eligible. 

                 <br>
                 Oldham Unity was established in 2001 and is run by a group of unpaid local volunteers, refugees and asylum seekers with donations from the general public.

                  <h2>Why people seeking asylum become destitute </h2>
                  <br>
                  The Home Office can take a long time – months and in many cases years – to make a decision on asylum. In September 2022, 143,377 people were waiting for an initial decision on their case, 2.5 times higher than in 2019. Sixty-eight per cent of them had waited for more than six months. The backlog of cases continues to grow, forcing individuals into many months in limbo, leading to destitution. 

                 <br>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Following a refusal, accommodation and financial support is withdrawn</li>
                      <li>Many asylum seekers come from countries where there is conflict, generalised violence and/or well documented human rights violations. Whilst they may not meet the narrow criteria for refugee status, they still hold very real fears for their safety in these countries, and, in some cases, our government agrees it is not safe for them to return home. For example, between 2002 and 2011, the government refused protection to thousands of Zimbabwean asylum seekers, but did not forcibly return any of them because it was not safe to do so.
                      </li>
                      
                      <p><li>Some newly granted refugees also fall into destitution as they are given only 28 days to leave their Home Office accommodation. Many find this too short a transition period to look for a home. Administrative delays in providing National Insurance numbers prevent people finding work or applying for mainstream benefits</li>
                        </p>
                  </ul>

                 The meeting ended with a call for volunteers to fill the positions of Chair(on a rotation), Secretary and Treasurer.
